In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression.

linear regression
-----------------
simple linear regression(predicting linear within two varibales x and y)
************************

-> To minimize the vertical line distance
-> residuals
-> regression line

independent value and dependent value 
-------------------------------------
independent = month(we can preduct only using the independent valu)
dependent = sales (we can sale the product at which month)

y = m (x)+ c -->regression line formula 
c = intercept
x = given vlaue
m = slop

multiple linear regression(it has the multiple col linear regression)
